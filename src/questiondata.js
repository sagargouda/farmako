        description: "Farmako is delivering medicines to you in just 30 minutes. We are the fastest medicine delivery service in India (maybe also in the world). Farmako has a very young team from IIT Roorkee and some of the best colleges in India. We experienced that there's no service which provided you medicines on demand in minutes. There are great pharmacy services solving for a planned medicine purchase but when it comes to acute cases, there's no one that provides end to end service and people have to rely on nearby pharmacies."
